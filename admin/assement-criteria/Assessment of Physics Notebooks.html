<h2>Assessment of Physics Notebooks</h2>
<!-- /handbook/PHY/header.html FINISH -->




<h3>BSc Procedures</h3>

<p>
	On the occasions specified in the module descriptor, each student will have their notebook(s) 
	read by an assessor and will then discuss their project in a short interview,
	normally lasting 10 minutes. Assessors will be rotated from
	one assessment to the next.
</p>

<h3>MPhys Procedures</h3>
<p>
	Each student will have their notebook(s) read by two assessors and answer
	questions in a <i>viva voce</i> examination normally lasting 20 minutes.
</p>
<h3>Common Procedures</h3>

	<!-- START OF ProjAssessment.incl -->In accordance with the published <a href="ExamConventions.html#MarkingStrategy">Marking Strategy</a>,each assessor should complete an individual pro-forma, on which comments are to be made and marksrecorded. These, along with a further pro-forma of 'agreed marks' are to be returned to the ModuleLead. All marks are subject to consistency checks and, if necessary moderation. The marks for thisassessment contribute to the overall module mark in proportion to the weighting indicated in themodule descriptor.<!-- END OF ProjAssessment.incl -->

<p>
	Marks (maximum total 100) are allocated under five headings:
</p>

<ol type=a>
	<li>Quality of the record keeping 
	<li>Effort and initiative
	<li>Technical prowess and practical scientific skills
	<li>Progress made
	<li>Oral performance
</ol>

<p>
judged according to the criteria below. The mark under heading (e)
relates directly to performance in the viva, and marks under the other
headings may be influenced by performance in the viva.
</p>
