<h2>Assessment of MPhys Introductory Reports</h2>
<!-- /handbook/PHY/header.html FINISH -->



<p>Each student will have their report read by two assessors and answer
questions in a <i>viva voce</i> examination normally lasting 20 minutes.

<!-- START OF ProjAssessment.incl -->In accordance with the published <a href="ExamConventions.html#MarkingStrategy">Marking Strategy</a>,each assessor should complete an individual pro-forma, on which comments are to be made and marksrecorded. These, along with a further pro-forma of 'agreed marks' are to be returned to the ModuleLead. All marks are subject to consistency checks and, if necessary moderation. The marks for thisassessment contribute to the overall module mark in proportion to the weighting indicated in themodule descriptor.<!-- END OF ProjAssessment.incl -->
</p>
<p>The overall mark for this assessment (out of 100) is obtained as follows:</p>

<h4>Report</h4>

Marks are given for to the following three areas:

<UL>

<LI><em>coverage (maximum 25)</em><BR>(completeness in terms of expected components: brief abstract, introduction describing aims and scientific
context of whole project, general physics background relevant to student's part of project, specific physics background to proposed work, future
plans, <i>etc.</i>),<p>

<LI><em>content (maximum 25)</em><BR> (appropriateness of material, scientific and literary accuracy of the text and diagrams),<p>

<LI><em>structure and presentation (maximum 25)</em><BR>(overall coherence and sequencing of material; overall appearance and accessibility of
the text and diagrams).<p>

</UL>

<p>
<table border=1 align=center width="85%">
<tr><th>Mark Range</th><th align=center >Qualities of Report</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center>21 - 25</td><td>A report that is difficult to fault, with the possible exception of one or two minor errors.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>18 - 20</td><td>Outcome at excellent level. No significant deficiencies, but a number of minor errors. Clear text and
diagrams with a well defined focus, reflecting a good knowledge of material and good competence in its critical assessment.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>15 - 17</td><td>Outcome at focal level. Only one or two significant deficiencies. Expected components present, with good
content, structure and presentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>13 - 14</td><td>No major flaws, but a number of significant deficiencies. Expected components present in an acceptable
form.</tr>
<tr><td align=center>10 - 12</td><td>Outcome at threshold level. Only one or two major flaws. Expected components present in a recognisable
form.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>5 - 9</td><td>A number of major flaws. Lacking in overall structure. Evidence of a lack of basic knowledge and critical
ability.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0 - 4</td><td>Nothing approaching an acceptable report.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<h4>Viva Voce Performance</h4>
Marks (maximum 25) are given to reflect the student's understanding of the
project and of related topics, as displayed during discussion of the report
with the assessors. The mark awarded by the the assessors will be based on
the following scale:
<p>
<table border=1 align=center width="85%">
<tr><th>Mark Range</th><th align=center>Quality of Discussion</th></tr>

<tr><td align=center>21 - 25</td><td>A thorough understanding of all aspects
which allows questions to be answered accurately and fluently and the discussion to
be extended with confidence into difficult or unfamiliar areas.</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>18 - 20</td><td>Outcome at excellent level. A thorough understanding of most aspects, with
some ability to extend the discussion into difficult or unfamiliar areas

<tr><td align=center>15 - 17</td><td>Outcome at focal level. An understanding of most aspects in some depth, with
the ability to extend the discussion so as to make relevant links (e.g., between
theory and the planned experiment).</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>13 - 14</td><td>An adequate understanding of most aspects, with some
ability extend the discussion so as to make relevant links.</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>10 - 12</td><td>Outcome at threshold level. A relatively superficial understanding of most
aspects, with the ability to make relatively simple links.</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>5 - 9</td><td>Little understanding shown. Unable to make
relevant links.</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>0 - 4</td><td>No understanding
demonstrated.</td></tr>
