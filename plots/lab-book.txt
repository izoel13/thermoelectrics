decided to abandon keeping the handwritten lab book, getting too far behind on it and it's taking me too much time to get it up to date

long day today.

Seebeck cofficient persistantly high, but we've managed to find the problem. We've been considering Si and Ge as intrinsic semiconductors, with a large band gap, when they're actually extrinsic at our temp range. This produces a too large Seebeck cofficient and severly decreases electrical conductivity, overall negatively effecting our thermoelectric.


Plan is to take a truely instrinsic semiconductor pair, PbTe and test all our results for this system.

Found some disserations on this stuff and a handbook of data.
Martin Gentile did a project with GP in the past, hes got extrinsic results.
