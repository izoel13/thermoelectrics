# Nanocomposite Thermoelectric Design
The private repository for Callum Vincent and Andrew Morris for a theoretical  MPhys project run by GP Srivastava from the University of Exeter.

## What's the plan?
We're investigating methods of obtaining thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) greater than 3. This may be through the use of nanocomposites or any other method we come up with.

## What's going here?
Project files, lab book scans, software, notes... everything that we possibly can, an online, backed up, revision controlled archive of all our work.
