Thermoelectrics are a promising area of materials research recently revitalised by the introduction of nanocomposites. In this project, we aim to derive a theoretical mechanism, through which new, high efficiency thermoelectric materials can be designed. This will involve a detailed understanding of the fundamental theories of solid-state physics, of which the phonon model plays a critical role. This theoretical project aims to guide expierment, keeping within practical limits and computationally modelling potential designs.

\subsection{Motivation}
% Why would you want do this?
Energy and its use defines human society. Throughout history we have seen an upwards trend of energy consumption and with it we transform our environment and our lives.

Thermoelectric materials have great potential to revolutionise our energy harvesting methods due to their ability to convert heat directly into electricity. This potential has motivated decades of research, resulting in;  radioisotope thermonuclear generators, solid state refrigerators and laser temperature control systems.

The main limitation of thermoelectric materials is their heat to electricity conversion efficiency. In modern applications, this is approximately 7\% \cite{modern-thermoelectrics}, roughly 4$\times$ lower than what is currently possible for internal combustion engines \cite{engine-efficiency}.

Recent advances in nano-fabrication have facilitated the development of  new nano-composite materials. Closely resembling metamaterials; nanocomposites are typically periodic arrays of nanoscale sheets, wires or particles. Arranging two or more materials like this has shown potential to increase the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT \cite{nanocomposite-zt}, a key parameter in the conversion efficiency discussed above.

\section{Background}
All the theories discussed in this report are transport processes. Fundamental to them all are the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of their particles.

\subsection{Boltzmann Equation}

% Explain the intuition behind the theory as if on a whiteboard
\subsection{Thermoelectricity}
In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that circuit made from two dissimilar metals, with junctions at different temperatures would deflect a compass magnet (\ref{seebeck-experiment}), he had discovered thermoelectricity. The temperature gradient $\vec{\nabla} T$ between the junctions generates an electromotive force:

\begin{equation}
\label{seebeck-emf}
	\vec{E_{emf}} = -S \vec{\nabla} T
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient, defined as the induced voltage per unit temperature difference, mathematically $\Delta S = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta T}$ \cite{auparay}. This coefficient is not only material dependent, but also temperature dependent, i.e., a temperature gradient produces an electromotive force gradient. This electromotive force gradient produces a current density gradient described macroscopically by a modified Ohm's law \cite{ziman}:

\begin{equation}
\label{current-density}
	\vec{J} = \sigma (-\vec{\nabla} V - S \vec{\nabla} T)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{J}$ and $\sigma$ are the current density $\frac{I}{A}$ and electrical conductivity at a given location in the material and $\vec{\nabla} T$ and $\vec{\nabla} V$ are the temperature and resultant voltage gradients across the material. If we were to repeat the experiment conducted by Seebeck (\figref{seebeck-experiment}), using a probe to measure $V$ between junctions and $\sigma$ at each junction for one of the metals, assuming steady state, i.e., $I=0$ so $\vec{J} = 0$, the metal's Seebeck coefficient can be determined.

Thermoelectricity, its uses and current nanocomposite research are well summarised by J. W. Bos \cite{bos-review} and A. J. Minnich \emph{et al.} \cite{minnich-review}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Nanocomposites}
Composite materials are combinations of two or more materials, forming a new structure with significantly different physical or chemical properties than its constituent parts. In a similar way, nanocomposites are the structuring of multiple materials, but at the nanoscale. As our nanocomposites are at a comparable size to the crystal lattices of their constituent materials, we can view nanocomposites as artificial defects in a larger crystal lattice. A simple example of a 2D nanocomposite, a copper-graphene superlattice, is pictured in \figref{superlattice}. Examining one layer of the superlattice, the material in bulk form would be a 3D crystal structure, but by constraining the layer thickness we have introduced a boundary defect. The periodic array of these boundary defects forms a new 3D artificial crystal, which we define as a superlattice, a nanocomposite.
