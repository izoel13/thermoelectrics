\noindent
Thermoelectrics are currently limited by their heat to electric conversion efficiency. If their efficiency can be improved 3$\times$ then a wide array of technological applications can be developed. Nanocomposite structuring is a potential technique for achieving this. We utilise an effective medium approximation to calculate the thermoelectric efficiency of a zero-dimensional SiGe nanocomposite. We find that silicon spheres of 10nm diameter densely packed in a germanium host medium, improves the thermoelectric efficiency 2.6$\times$ compared to a bulk SiGe semiconductor.
