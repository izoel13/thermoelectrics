abstract
Thermoeelectrics are a promising area of research, revitalised by the introdution of nanocomposites. If a a ZT>3 can be obtaied powerful new energy applications open. Reductions of .. in the thermal conductivity  have been proposed [1], leading to ZT>... Using nearly free, boltman transport,... we attempt toproduce a theroetical framework for nanocomposite thermoelectric design
