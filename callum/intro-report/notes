write in a similar manner to the introductory report
need lots of pictures
it's everything we know about solid state physics
	abbreviate solid state physics (SSP)?

do (prised from all my notes)
efficientcy stuff and zimann on microscopic stuff
discuss nanocomposites
	what are they?
	superlattice, 2D sandwich and how much better is it
		current research?
	more boundries better thermoelectric properties
		why is not clear
	2D quantum wells/superlattices, 1D quantum wires/nanowires, 0D quantum dot
blend in parts from the review papers
defects
	have different effects on phonons and electrons
discuss current thermoelectrics in more detail
	random alloys, the 1960's work
	low, medium, high, BiTe, PbTe, SiGe
	complex crystal structures get 30% better than single crystal bulks
Dresselhaus
deriving efficiency
	what is ZT? dimensionless
	minor variation in crystal growth has massive ZT impact
		ZT = \frac{S^2 \sigma \overline{T}}{\kappa_e + \kappa_{ph}}
			kappa_e is coupled to sigma, seebeck
			kappa_ph is independent
	\nu = \nu(Z\overline{T}, T_h, T_c)
	broad ZT peak preferable
	\kappa_e increases with high density of electrons
	free electrons, kappa, ZT graph, electron density different temp
Macroscopic transport coeff definition
	p270-275, section 7.5 & 7,6 Zimann Electrons and Phonons, Oxford, 1960
micoscopic transport (Kittel)
	vector E, q instead of e
Seebeck positive for p type, negative for n type
peltier effect - refridgeration applications efficiency
phonons (Zimann section 7.1
	fine when there are greater than 50 oscillators, good assumption even for nano structures
	K = \frac{1}{3} Cv \lambda
		K = \frac{1}{3} \sum_q(vector) \sum_s C_s(q) v_s(q) \lambda
			s is polarisation index
	linear combination of multiple oscillators = normal modes
	probability of energy packet states
	have infinite life in perfect infinite size sample
	at high temps boundry defects are the main scattering processes
	greater mass difference = more phonon scattering
	what are phonon collsions?
	possible 2-3x reduction
		electrons will always have a tradeoff
	higher temperature sees anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering
	nanostructuring can reduce the \kappa_{ph} close to the phonon glass limit
appendix
	current open questions
	my life story
	health and saftey forms
	acoustic stimulation of crystals to improve ZT?
effective mass?
	holes travel slower, larger effective mass
	encupasses all underlying physics
boltzmann transport zimann 7.3->7.4
	assume distribution function in space & time,
		electrons(rvector,t), phonons(rvector, t)
	in the presence of external field
		df/dt_field + df/dt_collsions = 0
	fermi dirac stuff
		equilbrium f\bar = \frac{1}{exp{\frac{E_k-E_f}{kT}}+1}
		n\bar = \frac{1}{exp{\frac{hbar \omega_q}{kT}}-1}
	distribution will change with relaxation time \tau
		phonons & electrons don't want to interact but thermal fields force them together
kinetic theroy of phonon & electron -> nearly free -> /tau, apply boltz
history -> current materials -> experimental improvements -> applications -> our goal -> kinetic theory -> condensed matter -> our solutions -> conclusion
PGEC
	regular arrangement for the electrons with large mean free path
	varied masses -> phonon glass
	bigger band gap reduces phonon velocity, so \kappa_ph
	electrons don't care about the masses of atoms
	how many ways to achieve PGEC? what constraints?
	seeing how far PGEC can go
	not many have done PGEC, computationally intensive
	few layers of dirty interfaces doesn't effect electrons
		big effect on phonons :D:D:D
there are different ways of maximising ZT, PGEC is one
cite often, print and keep a copy of citations with you, defend what is written
