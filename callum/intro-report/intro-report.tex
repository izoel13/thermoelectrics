Thermoelectrics are a promising area of materials research recently
revitalised by the introduction of nanocomposites. Obtaining a
thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT > 3$, potent new energy applications
are attainable. Current bulk thermoelectric materials reach $ZT < 1$,
realising practical efficiencies of ~4\%.\\
Reductions of # in phonon thermal conductivity $kappa_{ph}$ have been
suggested \cite{crc-handbook}, with potential for $ZT > #$. Applying the
Boltzmann transport equation to the phonon and nearly free electron
models for the concept of \acronym{PGEC}{phonon glass electron crystal}
\cite{crc-handbook}, we search for a theoretical mechanism through which
$kappa_{ph}$ can be reduced. If such a mechanism is discovered, we
will design and computationally model new material structures to
demonstrate its validity.

\section{Introduction}

From its discovery in 1821, thermoelectricity has seen constant
attention by the scientific community. Its source lies deep in the
fundamental nature of solid state materials. Through understanding
thermoelectricity we meld all the concepts underpinning
\acronym{SSP}{solid-state physics}; a well defined thermoelectric
theory is the pinnacle of \ac{SSP}.

%citations below? for the numbers?

Thermoelectricity is not only a central area of research for
\ac{SSP}, but also has enormous practical significance. Current
bulk thermoelectrics achieve thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ up to
one, which results in a practical thermal efficiency (heat to work) of
just 4\%, six times less than modern internal combustion engines.\\
Despite this low figure, thermoelectrics still see niche use
in refrigeration and space exploration due primarily to their
exceptional reliability. By increasing $ZT$ up to three, new
applications in heat recovery systems and solar thermal generators
emerge, improving the thermal efficiency of current power generation
methods. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to $ZT$, and as it
approaches infinity, efficiencies at the Carnot limit can be obtained.
If we achieve $ZT \to\infty$, all heat gradients will be maximally
exploitable for high value electrical energy; once where there were
water wheels, there became hydroelectric dams, now where there is
heat, there will be thermoelectricity.

\section{General Physics}
\subsection{Thermoelectricity}
In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a circuit made from two
dissimilar metals, with junctions at different temperatures would
deflect a compass magnet (\figref{seebeck-experiment}), he had
discovered thermoelectricity. The temperature gradient $\nabla
T$ between the junctions generates an electromotive force:

\begin{equation}
\label{seebeck-emf}
	E_{emf} = -S \nabla T
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient, defined as the induced voltage per
unit temperature difference, mathematically $\Delta S = \frac{\Delta
V}{\Delta T}$ \cite{auparay}. This coefficient is not only material
dependent, but also temperature dependent, i.e., a temperature gradient
produces an electromotive force gradient. This electromotive force
gradient produces a current density gradient described macroscopically
by a modified Ohm's law:

\begin{equation}
\label{current-density}
	J = \sigma (-\nabla V - S \nabla T)
\end{equation}
where $J$, $V$ and $\sigma$ are the current density $\frac{I}{A}$,
voltage and electrical conductivity at a given location in the
material. If we were to repeat the experiment conducted by Seebeck
(\figref{seebeck-experiment}), using a probe to measure $V$ and
$\sigma$ for one of the metals at both junctions, assuming steady state,
i.e., $I=0 \therefore J = 0$, the metals Seebeck coefficient can be
determined.\\
Analysing the flow of electrons through a material, a microscopic
expression of Ohm's law can be derived \cite{kittel}:
\begin{equation}
\label{micro-ohm}
	J = \frac{ne^2E \tau}{m_e}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the density of free electrons in the material, $e$ is the
elementary charge, $E$ is the electric field accelerating
electrons, $\tau$ is the mean time between electrons colliding with
something in the material and $m_e$ is the electron mass.

Thermoelectricity, its uses and current nanocomposite research are well
summarised by J. W. Bos \cite{bos-review} and A. J. Minnich et al.

\subsection{Nanocomposites}

Composite materials "are materials made from two or more constituent
materials with significantly different physical or chemical
properties, that when combined, produce a material with
characteristics different from the individual
components" \cite{wiki-composite}. Nanocomposites are identical in
concept to traditional composites, except the constituent materials
are at that nanoscale. As our nanocomposites are at a comparable size
to the crystal lattices of their constituent materials, we can view
nanocomposites as artificial defects in a larger crystal lattice. A
simple example of a 2D nanocomposite, a copper-graphene superlattice,
is pictured in \figref{superlattice}. Examining one layer of the
superlattice, the material in bulk form would be a 3D crystal structure,
but by constraining the layer thickness we have introduced a boundary
defect. The periodic array of these boundary defects forms a new 3D
artificial crystal, which we define as a superlattice, a nanocomposite.

	nanoscale copper and graphene are sandwiched together.}
\end{figure}

\section{Models and Assumptions}
For our project we will be using the nearly free electron model, which
assumes no electron-electron interactions

\subsection{\acf{PGEC}}
The core research topic for our project is the idea of PGEC.
