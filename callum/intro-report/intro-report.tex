Thermoelectrics are a promising area of materials research recently
revitalised by the introduction of nanocomposites. Obtaining a
thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT > 3$, potent new energy applications
are attainable. Current bulk thermoelectric materials reach $ZT < 1$,
realising practical efficiencies of ~4\%.\\
Reductions of # in phonon thermal conductivity $kappa_{ph}$ have been
suggested \cite{crc-handbook}, with potential for $ZT > #$. Applying the
Boltzmann transport equation to the phonon and nearly free electron
models for the concept of \acronym{PGEC}{phonon glass electron crystal}
\cite{crc-handbook}, we search for a theoretical mechanism through which
$kappa_{ph}$ can be reduced. If such a mechanism is discovered, we
will design and computationally model new material structures to
demonstrate its validity.

\section{Introduction}

From its discovery in 1821, thermoelectricity has seen constant
attention by the scientific community. Its source lies deep in the
fundamental nature of solid state materials. Through understanding
thermoelectricity we meld all the concepts underpinning
\acronym{SSP}{solid-state physics}; a well defined thermoelectric
theory is the pinnacle of \ac{SSP}.

%citations below? for the numbers?

Thermoelectricity is not only a central area of research for
\ac{SSP}, but also has enormous practical significance. Current
bulk thermoelectrics achieve thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ up to
one, which results in a practical thermal efficiency (heat to work) of
just 4\%, six times less than modern internal combustion engines.\\
Despite this low figure, thermoelectrics still see niche use
in refrigeration and space exploration due primarily to their
exceptional reliability. By increasing $ZT$ up to three, new
applications in heat recovery systems and solar thermal generators
emerge, improving the thermal efficiency of current power generation
methods. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to $ZT$, and as it
approaches infinity, efficiencies at the Carnot limit can be obtained.
If we achieve $ZT \to\infty$, all heat gradients will be maximally
exploitable for high value electrical energy; once where there were
water wheels, there became hydroelectric dams, now where there is
heat, there will be thermoelectricity.

\section{Background Theory}
\subsection{Thermoelectricity}
In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a circuit made from two
dissimilar metals, with junctions at different temperatures would
deflect a compass magnet (\figref{seebeck-experiment}), he had
discovered thermoelectricity. The temperature gradient $\vec{\nabla}
T$ between the junctions generates an electromotive force:

\begin{equation}
\label{seebeck-emf}
	\vec{E_{emf}} = -S \vec{\nabla} T
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient, defined as the induced voltage per
unit temperature difference, mathematically $\Delta S = \frac{\Delta
V}{\Delta T}$ \cite{auparay}. This coefficient is not only material
dependent, but also temperature dependent, i.e., a temperature gradient
produces an electromotive force gradient. This electromotive force
gradient produces a current density gradient described macroscopically
by a modified Ohm's law \cite{ziman}:

\begin{equation}
\label{current-density}
	\vec{J} = \sigma (-\vec{\nabla} V - S \vec{\nabla} T)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{J}$, $V$ and $\sigma$ are the current density $\frac{I}{A}$,
voltage and electrical conductivity at a given location in the
material. If we were to repeat the experiment conducted by Seebeck
(\figref{seebeck-experiment}), using a probe to measure $V$ and
$\sigma$ for one of the metals at both junctions, assuming steady state,
i.e., $I=0 \therefore \vec{J} = 0$, the metals Seebeck coefficient can be
determined.\\\\
Thermoelectricity, its uses and current nanocomposite research are well
summarised by J. W. Bos \cite{bos-review} and A. J. Minnich et al.
\cite{minnich-review}.

	one metal, underneath a bridge of a different metal (K), connected
	by two junctions and heated at one of these junctions.}
	\label{seebeck-experiment}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical Mechanics}
Using the kinetic theory, with relevant assumptions, charge density of
an arbitrary charge carrier can be described microscopically \cite{kittel}:
\begin{equation}
\label{charge-density}
	J = \frac{nq^2\vec{E} \tau}{m}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is free carrier density, $q$ is the charge of the
carrier, $\vec{E}$ is the electric field accelerating the
carrier, $\tau$ is the mean time between carrier collisions and $m$ is
carrier mass.\\
Applying this to solid-state electrical conductivity $\sigma = \frac{ne^2
\tau}{m^*}$ it can be shown \cite{ziman}:
\begin{equation}
\label{micro-elec}
	\sigma = \frac{e^2}{m^*} \sum_{\mathrm{spin}} \sum_{\vec{k}}
	n(\vec{k}) \tau(\vec{k})
\end{equation}
where $m^*$ is the electron effective mass, $\mathrm{spin}$ refers to
electron spin and $\vec{k}$ is the electron wavevector over the
Brillouin zone.

The Boltzmann transport equation "describes the statistical behaviour
of a thermodynamic system not in thermodynamic equilibrium"
\cite{wiki-boltz} and its general definition is:
\begin{equation}
\label{boltz-trans}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial
	t}\right)_\mathrm{force} + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{diff}+ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{coll}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ is time dependence of a system
of particles $f$, the "force" term represents external forces on the
particles, the "diff" term is the diffusion of particles through the
system and the "coll" term represents forces acting between particles
in collisions.

in the presence of an external field electron and phonon distributions
satisfy Boltzmann
\begin{equation}
\label{boltz-specific}
	\frac{df}{dt}\bigg|_{field} + \frac{df}{dt}\bigg|_{collisions} = 0
\end{equation}

%efficiency, or a separate section? probably put in applied theory
section

\subsection{Nanocomposites}

Composite materials "are materials made from two or more constituent
materials with significantly different physical or chemical
properties, that when combined, produce a material with
characteristics different from the individual
components" \cite{wiki-composite}. Nanocomposites are identical in
concept to traditional composites, except the constituent materials
are at that nanoscale. As our nanocomposites are at a comparable size
to the crystal lattices of their constituent materials, we can view
nanocomposites as artificial defects in a larger crystal lattice. A
simple example of a 2D nanocomposite, a copper-graphene superlattice,
is pictured in \figref{superlattice}. Examining one layer of the
superlattice, the material in bulk form would be a 3D crystal structure,
but by constraining the layer thickness we have introduced a boundary
defect. The periodic array of these boundary defects forms a new 3D
artificial crystal, which we define as a superlattice, a nanocomposite.

	nanoscale copper and graphene are sandwiched together.}

These questions are ideas that I have posed thus far in the project.
They are included as an interest to the reader, perhaps indicating
area of further study

\begin{itemize}
  \item Can acoustic stimulation of a material cause additional phonon
  collisions? Is a $kappa_{ph}$ reduction obtainable?
