\begin{abstract}
Thermoelectrics are a promising area of materials research recently
revitalised by the introduction of nanocomposites. In this project, we aim to derive a theoretical mechanism, through which new, high efficiency thermoelectric materials can be designed. This will involve a detailed understanding of the fundamental theories of solid-state physics, of which the phonon model plays a critical role. This theoretical project aims to guide expierment, keeping within practical limits and computationally modelling potential designs.

\section{Introduction}

From its discovery in 1821, thermoelectricity has seen constant
attention by the scientific community. Its source lies deep in the
fundamental nature of solid state materials. Through understanding
thermoelectricity we combine all the concepts underpinning solid-state physics. 

Thermoelectricity is not only a central area of research for
solid-state physics, but also has enormous practical significance. A key quantity in thermoelectrics is the figure of merit $ZT$, which is proportional to the total efficiency of thermoelectric conversion. Current bulk thermoelectrics achieve $ZT$ up to
one, which results in a practical thermal efficiency (heat to work) of
just 4\% \cite{minnich-review}, six times less than modern internal combustion engines \cite{engine-efficiency}.\\
Despite this low figure, thermoelectrics still see niche use
in refrigeration and space exploration due primarily to their
exceptional reliability. By increasing $ZT$ up to three, new
applications in heat recovery systems and solar thermal generators
emerge, improving the thermal efficiency of current power generation
methods. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to $ZT$, and as it
approaches infinity, efficiencies at the Carnot limit can be obtained.
If we achieve $ZT \to\infty$, all heat gradients will be maximally
exploitable for high value electrical energy.

%once where there were water wheels, there became hydroelectric dams, now where there is
%waste heat, there will be thermoelectricity.

\section{Background Theory}

\subsection{Thermoelectricity}
In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a circuit made from two
dissimilar metals, with junctions at different temperatures would
deflect a compass magnet (\figref{seebeck-experiment}), he had
discovered thermoelectricity. The temperature gradient $\vec{\nabla}
T$ between the junctions generates an electromotive force:

\begin{equation}
\label{seebeck-emf}
	\vec{E_{emf}} = -S \vec{\nabla} T
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient, defined as the induced voltage per
unit temperature difference, mathematically $\Delta S = \frac{\Delta
V}{\Delta T}$ \cite{auparay}. This coefficient is not only material
dependent, but also temperature dependent, i.e., a temperature gradient
produces an electromotive force gradient. This electromotive force
gradient produces a current density gradient described macroscopically
by a modified Ohm's law \cite{ziman}:

\begin{equation}
\label{current-density}
	\vec{J} = \sigma (-\vec{\nabla} V - S \vec{\nabla} T)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{J}$ and $\sigma$ are the current density $\frac{I}{A}$ and
electrical conductivity at a given location in the material and
$\vec{\nabla} T$ and $\vec{\nabla} V$ are the temperature and
resultant voltage gradients across the material. If we were to repeat the
experiment conducted by Seebeck (\figref{seebeck-experiment}), using a
probe to measure $V$ between junctions and $\sigma$ at each junction
for one of the metals, assuming steady state, i.e., $I=0$ so $\vec{J} = 0$, the metal's Seebeck coefficient can be determined.\\
Thermoelectricity, its uses and current nanocomposite research are well
summarised by J. W. Bos \cite{bos-review} and A. J. Minnich et al.
\cite{minnich-review}.

	one metal, underneath a bridge of a different metal (K), connected
	by two junctions and heated at one of these junctions.}
	\label{seebeck-experiment}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical Mechanics}
Using the kinetic theory, with relevant assumptions defined in \secref{project-discussion}, the charge density
$\vec{J}$ of an arbitrary charge carrier can be described
microscopically \cite{kittel}:

\begin{equation}
\label{charge-density}
	\vec{J} = \frac{nq^2\vec{E} \tau}{m}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is free charge carrier density, $q$ is the charge of the
carrier, $\vec{E}$ is the electric field accelerating the
carrier, $\tau$ is the mean time between carrier collisions and $m$ is
carrier mass.\\
Applying this to solid-state electrical conductivity $\sigma = \frac{ne^2
\tau}{m^*}$ it can be shown that \cite{ziman}:

\begin{equation}
\label{micro-elec}
	\sigma = \frac{e^2}{m^*} \sum_{\mathrm{spin}} \sum_{\vec{k}}
	n(\vec{k}) \tau(\vec{k})
\end{equation}
where $e$ is electron charge, $m^*$ is the electron effective mass, $\mathrm{spin}$ refers to
electron spin and $\vec{k}$ is the electron wavevector over the
Brillouin zone. These new concepts are all derived from the nearly free electron
model, as described in Kittel \cite{kittel}.\\
The Boltzmann transport equation ``describes the statistical behaviour
of a thermodynamic system not in thermodynamic equilibrium"
\cite{wiki-boltz} and its general definition is:

\begin{equation}
\label{boltz-trans}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial
	t}\right)_\mathrm{force} + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{diff}+ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{coll}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ is time dependence of a system
of particles $f$, the ``force" term represents external forces on the
particles, the ``diff" term is the diffusion of particles through the
system and the ``coll" term represents forces acting between particles
in collisions.\\
A phonon is the quantisation of vibrational motion of a lattice of
atoms at a single frequency, known as a normal mode \cite{kittel}. These phonons are
quasiparticles, free to move around the lattice and they are
distributed according to the Bose-Einstein distribution \cite{kittel}:

\begin{equation}
\label{bose-einstein}
	 \bar{n} = \frac{1}{e^{(\hbar \omega) / k T} - 1}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{n}$ is the probability of a phonon existing with energy
$\hbar \omega$.\\
Electrons can be modelled as quasiparticles in a similar way, with a
wavevector and effective mass as in equation \eqref{micro-elec},
leading to the Fermi-Dirac distribution \cite{kittel}:

\begin{equation}
\label{fermi-dirac}
	 \bar{f} = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_f) / k T} + 1}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{f}$ is the probability of an electron existing with energy
$E$ and $E_f$ is the Fermi level.\\
In the presence of an external fields, phonon and electron
distributions (\eqref{bose-einstein} \& \eqref{fermi-dirac}) both
satisfy the Boltzmann transport equation \eqref{boltz-trans} with
\cite{ziman}:

\begin{equation}
\label{boltz-specific}
	\frac{df}{dt}\bigg|_{field} + \frac{df}{dt}\bigg|_{collisions} = 0
\end{equation}
where function $f$ is $f = \bar{n}$ or $f = \bar{f}$, the Bose-Einstein
and Fermi-Dirac distribution functions.

\subsection{Nanocomposites}

Composite materials are combinations of two or more materials, forming a new structure with significantly different physical or chemical properties than its constituent parts. In a similar way, nanocomposites are the structuring of multiple materials, but at the nanoscale. As our nanocomposites are at a comparable size to the crystal lattices of their constituent materials, we can view
nanocomposites as artificial defects in a larger crystal lattice. A
simple example of a 2D nanocomposite, a copper-graphene superlattice,
is pictured in \figref{superlattice}. Examining one layer of the
superlattice, the material in bulk form would be a 3D crystal structure,
but by constraining the layer thickness we have introduced a boundary
defect. The periodic array of these boundary defects forms a new 3D
artificial crystal, which we define as a superlattice, a nanocomposite.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphene-superlattice.eps}
	\caption{Superlattice of graphene and copper. Alternate layers of
	nanoscale copper and graphene are sandwiched together.}
\end{figure}

\section{Project Theory Discussion}
\label{project-discussion}
\subsection{Assumptions}
For our project we will be using the phonon and nearly free electron models, which
bring with them a multitude of assumptions. For the phonon model, our
main assumption is that our system consists of at least 50 atomic oscillators
\cite{kittel}; this means we are limited to a $50\r{A} = 5
\mathrm{nm}$ fabrication size. Current fabrication methods are at best
25nm \cite{minnich-review}, so our 50 oscillator assumption is well met.
For both the phonon and the nearly free electron model, we assume an ideal gas,
i.e., particles do not interact with each other and can move freely
around the lattice, affected only by lattice perturbations. This is
known to be a good assumption for the low temperatures found in solid-state physics
\cite{kittel}.\\
Based on this limited initial analysis, we believe these assumptions
should be valid. If it transpires that these assumptions cannot be met, we will seek alternative models.\\

\subsection{Thermoelectric Efficiency}
The thermoelectric efficiency is best expressed in the dimensionless
parameter $ZT$ with thermal efficiency $\eta$ which is a function of $(ZT, T_h,
T_c)$, where $Z$ is the figure of merit, $T = \frac{1}{2}(T_h +
T_c)$, $T_h$ is the temperature at the hot junction and $T_c$ is the
temperature at the cold junction. $ZT$:
\begin{equation}
\label{zt}
	ZT = \frac{S^2 \sigma T}{\kappa_e + \kappa_{ph}}
\end{equation}
where $S$ is the Seebeck coefficient from equation \eqref{seebeck-emf}
\& \eqref{current-density}, $\sigma$ is electrical conductivity,
$\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_{ph}$ are the thermal conductivity due to
electrons and phonons respectively. This is derived in D. M. Rowe's Modern
Thermoelectrics \cite{modern-thermoelectrics}.\\
Important points to note about $ZT$ are that it is proportional to thermal efficiency $\eta$, is increased by a reduction in thermal conductivity and it depends on the square of the Seebeck coefficient. Figure \figref{zt-dope} demonstrates the comprimise between the variables in equation \eqref{zt}. $ZT$ values of current generation thermoelectric materials have been plotted in figure \figref{zt-plot}.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{zt-dope-plot.png}
	\caption{Graph of doping concentration (electron density) against $ZT$.  Insulators are seen up to $10^{19}$ with semi-conductors occupying the rest of the range. A compromise between variables $\sigma, \kappa, S^2$, results in heavily doped semi-conductors at the $ZT$ peak \cite{minnich-review}.}

\end{figure}

	\caption{Graph of thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ against
	temperature. The dashed line represents bulk thermoelectric materials, above the dashed line shows current generation nanocomposites \cite{minnich-review}.}
	\label{zt-plot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phonon Glass Electron Crystal}
A core concept for for our project is the idea of \ac{PGEC} first proposed by G. A. Slack \cite{crc-handbook}. Slack proposes that developing a material with the properties of both phonon scattering glasses and electron transmissive crystals, will achieve the desired $ZT > 3$. It is thought that the low dimensional systems of nanocomposites introduce the short range disorder of crystal structures common to glasses, yet they maintain the long range order common to electron crystals common \cite{crc-handbook}. Some key questions for our project are; How can we achieve \ac{PGEC}? What are its constraints? How effective is it at increasing $ZT$?

\section{Project Aims}
Thermoelectric theory provides a good basis from which we can
understand solid-state physics. Using phonon and nearly free electron models together with
the Boltzmann transport equation \eqref{boltz-trans} we aim to develop
a \ac{PGEC} inspired mechanism through which $ZT$ can be increased. If such a mechanism is found we will design novel structures and model them computationally. In pursuit of this aim, it is
likely that we utilise nanocomposite material design for the
introduction of multiple boundary defects.
