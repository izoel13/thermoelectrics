It seems certain that line spacing, font size and 60-70 characters per line improve readability

General tips:
Line height, 1.5em (use [golden-ratio-calculator][1])
Bigger text is better text
Use half line height for paragraph spacing
Lower page-text contrast
Multiply body size by 1.96x to get heading size

Assuming you have black text on white background. Don't use pure black
(#000000) - use anything between: #222222 to #555555.
If you can don't use pure white (#FFFFFF). Make it off white: #FAFAFA,
#F9F9F9, #F8F8F8 etc. work great. But it's often hard to make it work
so treat this as optional.

Montserrat - Proxima Nova clone
Nouvelle Vague - Hard to read script font, probably harder to read than current estimate

Fiddle with the body text size to get the optimum characters per line
