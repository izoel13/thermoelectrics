It seems certain that line spacing, font size and 60-70 characters per line improve readability

General tips:
Line height, 1.5em (use [golden-ratio-calculator][1])
Bigger text is better text
Use half line height for paragraph spacing
Lower page-text contrast
Multiply body size by 1.96x to get heading size

Assuming you have black text on white background. Don't use pure black
(#000000) - use anything between: #222222 to #555555.
If you can don't use pure white (#FFFFFF). Make it off white: #FAFAFA,
#F9F9F9, #F8F8F8 etc. work great. But it's often hard to make it work
so treat this as optional.


Title: Knockout
Large text: Proxima Nova Regular
Small text or emphasis/quotes: Tisa (serif)

Palatino Linotype


Montserrat - Proxima Nova clone
Nouvelle Vague - Hard to read script font, probably harder to read than current estimate

Title - Knockout
Subtitles - Montesserat
Text - Palatino Linotype

Fiddle with the body text size to get the optimum characters per line


Stuff to do
===========

Diagrams
	At least 700 pixels across
	Line art pictures
	Applications and graphs
	Draw precisely our set up? (nanospheres of Si in Ge host)

Colour scheme
	at least three tone, titles, background, boxes
	
References
	even if we don't quote them in the text, for further reading
	solar thermal paper?
	
Which name?
	G.P. Srivastva
	G. P. Srivastva
	Prof. G. P. Srivastva
	Supervisor - GP Srivastva

Which other subtitles?
	P/N junctions?
	Assumptions

3 columns
	background/history
	
	results

what we're doing is really a fesability study, we're pulling together
multiple diffferent models
why max volume fraction?
why minimal nano particle diameter?
get electrical conductivity plots

specularity EMA vs modified EMA
	we have shown that the inclusion of specularity physics has minimal
	effect on modified EMA
